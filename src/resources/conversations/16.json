      "Hey all. I know it's close to the deadline for Pongchamps, but Sophia just wrapped up one of her customer research experiments, and based on the results we think our marketing strategy needs to be changed up a bit. While I know it's not yet implemented, the player character customization was a massive hit. Any chance one of you could quickly swap out the player character with a new one and send me a build of the game so that I can take a quick video? I think it will make the game's trailer much more impactful to have this."
