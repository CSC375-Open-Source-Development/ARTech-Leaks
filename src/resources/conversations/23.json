      "Hi Andrew -- quick question. Sophia and I are just doing our final prep before taking off for the big shareholders conference tomorrow and noticed that the Pongchamps bug where the ball could get stuck in the paddle is there there. I remember you guys saying at standup today that you fixed that already so I just want to make sure we have the most up to date version of the game."

While normally our most up to date code is on the master branch, that bug fix was so last minute we didn't have time to get through all the required approvals to merge it in (Tom being out has made that process a bit more difficult...). The branch named \"dev\" has the most up to date version of the game with that bug fixed. Do you need me to help you access that branch?"
