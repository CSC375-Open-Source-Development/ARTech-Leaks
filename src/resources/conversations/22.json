Sophia mentioned to me that she has another experiment she needs stood up and I wanted to do it for her this time around, so I was wondering if you could give me (and @Brian if he is available) a quick walkthrough sometime today?"

      "Use ssh to log into the build server from your command line via its ip address (which is listed on the Confluence documentation page in case you lose it). You will need to ssh in using your private cloud username, and then will need to enter in your prive cloud password when it prompts you. Once you're in, you will then have access to the build server's terminal from your own and can run commands on it. From there you can clone any repo or run any pipeline, but for what Sophia needs, you'll just need to run one of the pre-created scripts and pass in her desired domain name as an argument."
