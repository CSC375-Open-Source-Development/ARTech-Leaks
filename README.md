# ARTech-Leaks

## What is this?

This website was created for an in-class activity for Quinnipiac's open-source development course.

The website is hosted on GitHub pages at [https://csc375-open-source-development.github.io/ARTech-Leaks](https://csc375-open-source-development.github.io/ARTech-Leaks).

## How to run locally?

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, and then `npm run serve`, and then go check out `localhost:8080`.
This uses Vue 2 so I think it may not work with a Node version higher than 16, but I'm not positive on that.
